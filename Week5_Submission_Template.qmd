<!-- Briefly describe your app , It's main features and how to use it. -->

App Description: *This interactive Shiny application provides comprehensive time series forecasting for Australian wine sales data spanning from 1980 to 1994. The app enables users to analyze historical sales patterns across six wine categories (Fortified, Red, Rose, Sparkling, Sweet White, and Dry White) and generate forecasts using three sophisticated statistical models. Users can customize training periods, compare model performance, and visualize predictions with confidence intervals through an intuitive interface.*

App Features:

-   *Interactive Data Exploration* - Select multiple wine varietals and customize date ranges to focus on specific time periods and wine types of interest
-   *Flexible Train/Test Splits* - Define custom training end dates to evaluate model performance on held-out validation data
-   *Multiple Forecasting Models* - Automatically fits and compares three models: TSLM (trend and seasonal regression), ETS (exponential smoothing), and ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average)
-   *Dynamic Forecast Visualization* - Interactive Plotly charts display historical data, forecasts with prediction intervals, and clear train/validation boundaries
-   *Model Performance Metrics* - Comprehensive accuracy tables showing RMSE, MAE, and MAPE for both training and validation periods across all models
-   *Detailed Model Specifications* - View the automatically selected parameters for each model (ETS states, ARIMA orders, seasonal components)
-   *Adjustable Forecast Horizon* - Generate forecasts for 1-24 months ahead to support short and medium-term planning

## Part II — Data Story (≤ 2 pages total)

```{=html}
<!-- Insight (2–3 sentences, concise)
State your key finding and why it matters. Example: “Sparkling shows consistent December spikes; ETS(M,A,M) outperforms ARIMA on validation RMSE, so it’s the more reliable seasonal model for forward planning.” -->
```

```{=html}
<!-- Evidence (screenshots + narrative + minimal tables) 
Insert screenshots from your app that support your insight. Use short, descriptive captions and list the app inputs so we can reproduce each figure. -->
